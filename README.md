# TypeScript React Native App

## Intro
This is a project demoing the use of TypeScript in a React Native app. We created it during our first ReactSA Hackanhour using [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@rintoj/react-native-with-typescript-40355a90a5d7). Join our slack to find out when the next one will be! [https://reactsa.slack.com/](https://reactsa.slack.com/)

## Getting Started
Make sure you have yarn installed: [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

`git clone [repo_url]` and cd into folder

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

open up another terminal and cd into project directory, then:

`yarn run ios` for building and running on an iOS simulator.

_Note: I haven't had to do it this way for other RN apps I've worked on, but for some reason it's the only way I can get this one to build correctly on an iOS simulator._

## What we need!
I haven't set up the project to work on Android yet. If that's the way you roll in the RN world set it up and submit a pr por favor!
